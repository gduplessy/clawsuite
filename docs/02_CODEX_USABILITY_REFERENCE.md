# Codex Usability Reference

## What "Codex" Means Here

Codex refers ONLY to:
> The OpenAI Codex App (desktop / IDE-style experience)

NOT:
- Codex API
- Codex source code
- Codex internal architecture

## How Codex Is Used

Codex is a benchmark for:
- Session clarity
- Permission visibility
- "It just works" reliability
- Clear execution context

## What Is NOT Allowed

- Copying Codex code
- Pixel-perfect UI cloning
- Replicating Codex internals

## Guiding Translation

Codex concepts MUST be mapped to OpenClaw primitives:
- Repo → Workspace / Gateway
- Tools → Skills
- Model selector → Agent profile
