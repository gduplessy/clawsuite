# Phase 4 — Differentiation

## Goal

Build what Codex cannot. These features make Studio the reason to use OpenClaw over alternatives.

## Deliverables

1. **Multi-agent orchestration UI** — Visual view of multiple agents working together, message passing, dependencies
2. **Workflow builder** — Visual drag-and-drop pipeline editor for agent workflows (THE differentiator)
3. **Skill permission inspector** — See exactly what each skill can access (FS, network, browser) before enabling
4. **Agent kill-switch** — One-click emergency stop for any running agent/session
5. **Plugin marketplace** — Browse, install, and manage Gateway plugins from Studio
6. **Collaboration** — Multi-user shared workspaces (future)

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Workflow builder can create and execute a multi-step agent pipeline
- [ ] Users can inspect and approve skill permissions before first run
- [ ] Kill-switch stops agent execution within 2 seconds
